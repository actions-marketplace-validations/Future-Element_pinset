# Work directory environments / 工作目录环境

Available in the combined Pinset 2.15.0 environment release.

Each worktree or workspace member uses its own checked-out `pinset.toml` and `pinset.lock`. Run `pinset setup --plan`, then `pinset setup` in an already-created directory. Pinset does not create branches or worktrees.

| State | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Verified downloads and base SDK installations | Shared by exact version, installation options, archive identity and target |
| Local profile choice, trust, preparation/probe context and editor binding ownership | Canonical directory, directory generation and runtime host |
| Python venv | Member-local path with directory/host ownership marker |
| Flutter SDK/cache | Owned local copy under `PINSET_HOME/state/workspaces`; never hard-linked to another directory's mutable files |
| Project dependencies, build outputs and task files | Remain project-owned; Pinset does not link these between worktrees |

Flutter uses compact directory components for Windows path compatibility; full directory and SDK receipt identities remain in its ownership marker and are checked before reuse.

Directory identity includes the filesystem file ID and birth time, so editing project files retains the directory identity while deleting/recreating or moving the directory invalidates local state. Symbolic directory aliases resolve to one canonical identity. Filesystems without reliable birth-time support return an error rather than reusing unbound local state. Host identity stays local and is excluded from portable reports. This is a namespace boundary, not an OS sandbox or a promise to intercept arbitrary external tools.

Workspace members may inherit the root environment declaration and encrypted profile files. `pinset env use` selects a profile for that member only. Trust the member explicitly before injection; trusting the root does not trust every member. A member override owns its own encrypted files. `pinset env` and the environment report use the effective declaration; `configuration_origins` explains root defaults, member overrides and check scope. The editor Environment panel displays these origins. Editing an inherited encrypted profile edits its root-owned file, so that change is shared by inheriting members.

工作目录移动、重建或换宿主后，需要重新选择本机 profile、信任项目并准备环境。已有解密身份可以继续使用，但不会因此自动扩展信任范围。配置来源和检查范围可通过环境报告以及 VS Code Environment 面板查看。

## Existing local state and rollback

- Legacy profile records are never automatically adopted. Explicit `pinset env use <profile>` or `pinset env use --reset` preserves the old record as a versioned `.bak` file before creating/resetting the new choice.
- Legacy trust files remain untouched. Re-run `pinset trust add` only after reviewing the effective declaration in this directory.
- Legacy Python markers lack host/directory identity. `pinset venv recreate [name]` preserves the whole legacy directory in a sibling `.pinset-backup-*` directory before building a fresh venv. A marker belonging to another known directory/host is not permission to delete that venv.
- Old editor binding records remain in extension storage. New records include directory identity; automatic restoration only operates on matching records whose current setting still equals the recorded Pinset value. Review older settings manually.
- Old local state is retained for inspection. Pinset does not recursively sweep unknown state. SDK pruning rechecks registered project references; records from a different host block shared-SDK pruning until their references can be reviewed.

Returning to an older Pinset binary may require restoring that binary's backed-up local profile/venv state explicitly. Configuration/lock migration backups and application data are separate. Do not merge isolated mutable directories together as a rollback procedure.

## Validation boundary

Linux Docker unit and process tests cover directory replacement, aliases, foreign-host trust, independent member profiles and inherited ciphertext, legacy profile/venv preservation, local Flutter cache copies and shared SDK reference protection. Native Windows/macOS, SSH, WSL and editor execution evidence are tracked separately; these tests alone do not establish those entry points.
